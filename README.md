## Introduction

This application was conceived as a blueprint for rapid full-stack development, offering the seamless integration of a dynamic React front-end and a robust, scalable Node.js back-end. This amalgamation of technologies ensures that developers can focus on building features without the usual setup overhead.

## Technologies Used

### Frontend

- **Vite**: A build tool that boasts a faster and leaner development experience for modern web projects.
- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It allows us to create reusable UI components.
- **TypeScript**: A superset of JavaScript, offering static type-checking and the latest ECMAScript features.
- **TailwindCSS**: A utility-first CSS framework packed with classes like `flex`, `pt-4`, `text-center` and more to style your websites without leaving your HTML.
- **React-Router-Dom**: A routing library for React, enabling navigation among views.
- **Framer-motion**:
- **Clerk**:

### Backend

- **Node.js**: A JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine.
- **Express**: A minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications.
- **TypeScript**: Brings static typing to JavaScript, ensuring a more predictable runtime behavior.
- **Prisma**: 
- **MySQL**: 
- **Nodemon**: A utility that monitors for any changes in your source and automatically restarts your server.

## Installation

Before you start, ensure you have `node` and `npm` installed on your machine. 

1. **Clone the repository**:
   
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/gabrielkrapp/full-stack-template.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the repository**:

   ```bash
   cd product-hunt-clone
   ```

3. **Install the dependencies**:

   - For Frontend:
   
     ```bash
     npm install
     ```

   - For Backend:

     ```bash
     npm install
     ```

## Running the Application

- **To run the frontend**:

  ```bash
  npm run dev
  ```

  This starts the React application on `http://localhost:5173` (or another available port).

- **To run the backend**:

  ```bash
  npm run dev
  ```

  This initializes the Express server, typically on `http://localhost:8080`.



## Conclusion

This full-stack application setup is intended to accelerate the development process by providing a cohesive blend of some of the best technologies in web development today. Whether you're looking to create a small prototype or build a large-scale application, this repository provides a solid foundation. Happy coding!
